# GCRFs tool

The GCRFs tool is an open-source software that integrates vari-ous GCRF methods and supports training and testing of those methods on synthetic andreal-world  datasets.

# Methods included

- Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF) is structured regression model that incorporates the outputs of unstructuredpredictors (based on the given attributes values) and the correlation between output vari-ables in order to achieve a higher prediction accuracy. 

- Directed  GCRF  (DirGCRF)  extends  the  GCRF  method  byconsidering asymmetric similarity (directed graphs).

- Unimodal GCRF (UmGCRF) extends the GCRF parameter spaceto allow negative influences and improves computational efficiency.

- Marginalized GCRF (m-GCRF) extends GCRF to naturallyhandle missing labels, rather than expecting the missing data to be treated in a preprocess-ing stage. 

- Uncertainty Propagation GCRF (up-GCRF) takes into ac-count uncertainty that comes from the data when estimating uncertainty of the predictions. 

- Representation  Learning  based  Structured  Regression  (RLSR) simultaneously learns hidden representation of objects and relationships among outputs.
