<font color=blue> Structured regression </font> models are designed to use relationships between objects for predicting output variables. 
</p>
<p>
In other words, structured regression models consider the attributes of objects and dependencies between the objects 
</p>
<p>
to make predictions. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<font color=blue> The Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF)</font>  model is one type of structured regression models that incorporate the
</p>
<p>
outputs of unstructured predictors (based on the given attributes values) and the correlation  between output variables 
</p>
<p>
in order to achieve a higher prediction accuracy. This model was first applied in computer vision, but since then it
</p>
<p>
has been used in different applications, and extended for various purposes.
</p>
<p></p>
<p> 
<font color=blue> GCRF GUI TOOL </font> integrates various GCRF methods and supports training and testing those methods on real-world 
</p>
<p> 
data from different domains. To calculate the regression accuracy of all methods, we used R2 coefficient of 
</p>
<p> 
 determination that measures how closely the output of the model matches the actual value of the data. A score of 0 
</p>
<p>
indicates a very poor matching, while a score of 1 indicates a perfect match.
