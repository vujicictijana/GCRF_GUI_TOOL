This directory contains an initial version of the code release to
accompany the paper "Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields:
Algorithms, Theory, and Application to Energy Forecasting."  The code
requires the Eigen3 linear algebra library (freely available at
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), and can be compiled from within MATLAB
using:

>> mex gcrf_newton.cc gcrf_newton_mex.cc -I/usr/include/eigen3 

(replacing -I/usr/include/eigen3 with the appropriate directory of
your Eigen installation).

The function can be called from MATLAB as:

[Lambda Theta h] = gcrf_newton_mex(S, lambda, Lambda0, Theta0, params)
where:
 - S is the joint sample covariance matrix
 - lambda is the L_1 regularization parameter
 - Lambda0 and Theta0 are initial values for the parameters
 - params is a struct that can contain the following files
    quiet: 1 to output no debugging info
    max_iters: maximum number of outer loop iterations
    ls_max_iters: maximum of inner loop iterations
    sigma, alpha, beta: backtracking line search parameters
    tol: convergence tolerance of the outer loop
    cd_tol: convergence tolerance of the inner loop
